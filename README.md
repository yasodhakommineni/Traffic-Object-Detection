 Implemented a deep learning-based object detection model using the YOLO algorithm, which detects and classify
 objects in traffic images by creating bounding boxes.
 Concepts like Non-max suppression, Intersection over Union, Anchor boxes are used for the project.
 Tools Used: Tensor Flow, Numpy, Pandas.
